Message Body:
Hello, I would like to inquire about the current situation in my neighborhood. The void deck in my block is very dirty and emits a foul odor. Furthermore, bulk items are not being cleared on a daily basis, resulting in an unsightly view. The trees are also not being pruned regularly, which has led to small bugs entering our homes. I would greatly appreciate prompt action regarding this matter.
